=============================

I have implemeneted the decision tree and Random forest algorithms in R for the kaggle project Titanic
using the tutorial provided by Trevor Stephens(http://trevorstephens.com/).

My learnings are documented here - http://shyamalapriya.github.io/random-forests-titanic-in-kaggle/
